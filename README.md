This is Exercise 20 from MI4 in Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program.

# Overview

RSK is the Smart Contract platform of Bitcoin. Its engine is a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine),
and the RVM (RSK Virtual Machine) is compatible with Ethereum Smart Contracts and the tools used to deploy and
interact with them.

The Smart Bitcoin (R-BTC) is the native token in RSK and it is used to pay for the gas required for the execution of
transactions. It is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, which means in RSK there are exactly 21M R-BTC. A 2-way peg (2WP)
allows the transfer of bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to the RSK blockchain and vice-versa.
